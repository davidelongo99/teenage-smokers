In this research, we focus on understanding the role that interdependence between individuals, relational ties and inclusion within a social system play in influencing a given smoking behaviour. To do so, we resorted to implementing a Social Network Analysis and Social Network Theory, which focuses on the understanding of the interdependence between individuals and, therefore, on the relational ties that exist between individuals within a social system. By applying this theory we assume that human beings in a social system act as relevant reference points in each other's decision-making process.

This research aims to understand whether the relationship between individuals can induce a change in smoking behaviour. In particular, we aim to explore if the following hypotheses are proven:
1. Does a high number of close friends impact the likelihood that an individual start to smoke cigarettes?
2. Does having a close relationship with smoking friends impact the   likelihood of non-smokers starting to smoke cigarettes?
3. Does having close relationships with smoking friends  of the same sex impact on the likelihood of non-smokers starting to smoke cigarettes?
